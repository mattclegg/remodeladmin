Usage Overview
--------------

Default Summary Fields:

Can specify which summary fields are selected by default by putting something like this in the model:

```php
	static $summary_fields = array(
		'Name' => 'Name',
		'Email' => 'Email',
		'Created' => 'Date',
		'PageID' => 'Page'
   );
   
	static $default_summary_fields = array(
		'Name',
		'Email',
		'Created'
   );
```

Name, Email, Created and Page will all be available in the list of fields but only Name, Email and Created will be checked by default.
If $default_summary_fields isn't set then everything in $summary_fields will be on by default.
